            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! My name is Andrija Stosic, and I am a passionate and curious young programmer. My journey into the world of technology began at a very early age, and since then, I have been fascinated by the endless possibilities that coding and software development offer. Over the years, I have dedicated myself to learning and mastering various programming languages and technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I am deeply involved in software development and web design. I enjoy creating user-friendly applications and visually appealing websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My projects range from simple static pages to dynamic, interactive applications. One of my favorite aspects of web development is the ability to combine creativity with technical skills to bring ideas to life.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to web development, I have a strong interest in Python programming. I have gained experience in developing GUI applications using Tkinter and performing data analysis with libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib. I find Python to be an incredibly versatile language that allows me to tackle a wide variety of challenges, from building games to analyzing complex data sets.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of programming, I have a wide range of interests and hobbies. I love reading books, particularly those related to science fiction and technology, as they fuel my imagination and inspire new project ideas. I also enjoy exploring new technologies and staying updated with the latest trends in the tech world. This continuous learning process is something I find very exciting and rewarding.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I am not immersed in the world of code, I like to spend quality time with my family and friends. Whether it's playing sports, going on trips, or simply hanging out, these moments are very important to me. I believe that maintaining a balance between work and personal life is essential for overall well-being and creativity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking ahead, I am excited about the future and the opportunities it holds. I plan to continue expanding my knowledge and skills in programming, with a particular interest in areas such as artificial intelligence and mobile app development. My goal is to contribute to the tech community by creating innovative solutions that can make a positive impact on people's lives.
